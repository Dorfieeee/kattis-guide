# Trees

Trees are used to represent hierarchical information, or to organise data to speed up searches.

<!-- One node is the root of the tree. Each node has zero or more children nodes.
In an _n_-ary tree each node has at most _n_ children.
A leaf is a childless node.
 -->

## Paths

- [Kitten on a Tree](https://open.kattis.com/problems/kitten) (11 LOC):
  Print the path from a given node to the root.

- [Numbers On a Tree](https://open.kattis.com/problems/numbertree) (12 LOC):
  Given a path from the root, compute the number of the node arrived at.
  This problem requires knowing how nodes are numbered in a binary heap.
  The input is just one line, but it may have one or two data.
