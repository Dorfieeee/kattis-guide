# Exhaustive search

These problems can be solved by exhaustively generating candidate solutions and
keeping those that satisfy the problem's requirements, e.g. the best solution.
This approach is also called brute-force search, or generate and test.

## Linear search

A linear search does a single pass over all candidates.
