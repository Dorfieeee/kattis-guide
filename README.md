# A Guide to Kattis Problems

[Kattis](https://open.kattis.com) is a competitive programming platform with
over 2500 problems. Users can submit their solutions in about 20 different programming languages. The system runs each submission against hidden tests. If all tests pass, the user gets the points associated to that problem.
The points of a user contribute to the points of her/his country and school.

These pages are my classification and notes of the Kattis problems I solved.
They were written to help teachers select problems that are adequate to
the level and knowledge of their class.
They should also be useful to those using Kattis outside formal education.
