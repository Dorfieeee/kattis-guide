# A Guide to Kattis Problems

[Kattis](https://open.kattis.com)
is a competitive programming platform with a clean and modern interface.
Users can register with their Azure, Facebook, Google or LinkedIn accounts,
if they wish.
Users can submit their solutions in about 20 different programming languages.
Kattis runs each submission against hidden tests.
If all tests pass, the user gets the points associated to that problem.
Each user's points contribute to the points of their country and school.
The [help page](https://open.kattis.com/help) has more details
on how to submit and the scoring system.
Users solve problems at their leisure but may also participate in time-limited
contests, each with a selection of Kattis problems.

Problems on Kattis and similar platforms
cover many algorithms and data structures,
and they are good practice to pay attention to details,
separate the wheat from the chaff in a problem description,
and think of edge cases where the algorithm may fail.

Kattis has over 2500 problems from many
[competitions and training sessions](https://open.kattis.com/problem-sources),
so where to start and how to progress?
Kattis suggests problems mostly by difficulty, i.e. number of points.
Here I classify some problems according to the algorithmic approach or
data structure I used to solve the problem.
I hope this helps teachers select problems that are appropriate to the
knowledge of their pupils.

I aim to list around 5 problems for each algorithm or data structure,
by order of difficulty, according to my judgement. Your mileage may vary.

For each problem I provide a direct link to its Kattis page,
where you can find the number of points and submit your solution.
I also provide the number of lines of code (LOC) of my Python 3 solution,
but longer programs are not necessarily more difficult.
I don't count blank and comment lines.
I don't use semicolons to join two short lines into one.
I use list comprehensions and conditional expressions moderately.

- [Foundations](foundations.md): sequence, selection, iteration, integers, floats, strings
- [Ordered collections](ordered.md): sorting, lists, stacks, queues, deques
- [Unordered collections](unordered.md): dictionaries, sets, bags
- [Exhaustive search](exhaustive.md): linear search
