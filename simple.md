# Simple algorithms

## Sequence

These problems can be solved with a sequence of assignment and `print()`
statements. No if's, no loops.

- [Hello World!](https://open.kattis.com/problems/hello):
The classic program to print 'Hello, World!'.
Arguably the easiest Kattis problem, but surprisingly 43% of submissions failed.
It looks like many users type it too quickly and submit without checking.
Many users don't solve any problem after registering on Kattis, so solving just
this one is enough to climb thousands of places in the rankings.

- [Solving for Carrots](https://open.kattis.com/problems/carrots):
A silly description of a trivial problem.
A good introduction to ignoring irrelevant details.

- [Simple Addition](https://open.kattis.com/problems/simpleaddition):
Add two large integers. Trivial in Python.

- [Faktor](https://open.kattis.com/problems/faktor):
A little arithmetic tongue-in-cheek problem about the academic obsession with
bibliometrics.
