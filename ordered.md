# Ordered collections

These problems can be solved using some form of sequence,
i.e. a collection where the order of items matters.
Some problems become easier by sorting the items.
Sometimes items must be sorted for output, to enable automated testing.

## Sorting

These problems can be solved using function `sorted` or method `sort` to put
the items in ascending or descending order.
